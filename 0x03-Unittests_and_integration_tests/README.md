# ALX Backend Python - Unit and Integration Testing

## Overview

This project contains a suite of unit and integration tests for the `GithubOrgClient` class and utility functions (`utils.py`). The tests are designed to validate the correctness and robustness of the codebase, specifically focusing on:

- Accessing nested maps with `access_nested_map`
- HTTP request handling and JSON parsing in `get_json`
- Memoization with the `memoize` decorator
- GitHub API client functionality in `GithubOrgClient`
- Integration tests that simulate external API responses using mocked fixtures

---

## Technologies and Libraries

- Python 3.7
- unittest (Python standard library)
- unittest.mock for patching and mocking
- parameterized for parameterized test cases
- pytest (optional, for running tests)
